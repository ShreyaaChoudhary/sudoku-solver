# sudoku-solver
This project demonstrates the use of recursion and constraint satisfaction techniques in solving a well-known mathematical puzzle.

# Features
- Input Validation: The solver checks if the Sudoku puzzle is valid before attempting to solve it.
- Backtracking Algorithm: Efficiently solves a 9x9 Sudoku grid.
- Error Handling: Handles edge cases like unsolvable puzzles.
- Readable Output: Displays the solved Sudoku grid in a clean, formatted way.
- Optimized Performance: Includes optimizations to reduce backtracking calls and improve performance.
